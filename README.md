# StuVe_rooms2020
GeoJson files (maps) for mapping public and quasi-public rooms of the StuVe@Uulm on an OSM-Type Map

The first version of this file was created with <umap.openstreetmap.de>
Worklink: <https://umap.openstreetmap.de/de/map/anonymous-edit/2550:XoHenbQpgNNkk1GtzKfr5f2edZc>

Because different "OSM-Viewers" work different, testing was done on several other sites
- <https://geojson.net/#16/48.4236/9.9559>
- <http://geojson.tools/>
